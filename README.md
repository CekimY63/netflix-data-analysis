# 📊 Netflix Content Strategy Analysis

## 🎯 Project Goal
Analyzing the evolution of Netflix content over the years using Python and Pandas.
I wanted to answer: **Does Netflix focus more on Movies or TV Shows?**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (Google Colab)

## 🔎 Key Findings
1. **Movies are King:** About **70%** of the content are movies.
2. **Explosive Growth:** Huge spike in productions between 2015 and 2019.
3. **Recent Drop:** The data ends in 2021, showing a deceptive drop in content.
